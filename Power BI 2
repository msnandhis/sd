This setup is fully feasible and actually a great way to bring natural language querying into Power BI using GPT + Copilot Studio + Power Automate.

Let’s break down each step in detail and explain how/why it works, including what each component does and what to watch for:


---

✅ High-Level Feasibility

This architecture is solid and currently achievable with:

Power BI Premium Workspace

Power Automate

OpenAI GPT-4 API

Copilot Studio (Power Virtual Agents)


You’re combining these tools for:

1. Natural Language Understanding (GPT)


2. Dynamic Query Execution (Power BI DAX)


3. Bot Interaction (Copilot Studio)

🔍 Breakdown of Each Flow Step


---

1️⃣ Prepare Your Power BI Dataset

✅ Feasibility: 100%

📌 What it does:

You must have your data modeled in Power BI with table and column names clearly defined. This helps GPT generate valid DAX.

Must be hosted in a Premium Workspace to enable query execution via API.


📌 Why it matters:

GPT needs a schema reference to generate accurate DAX.

Without Premium workspace, query execution via REST API is not available.



---

2️⃣ Create Power Automate Flow

✅ Feasibility: 100%

📌 What it does:

Automates the middle logic between Copilot and Power BI.

Acts as your logic hub.


Now, step-by-step:


---

🔹 Step 1: Trigger by Copilot Studio

Use "When a Power Virtual Agent calls a flow"

Accept user input as userQuestion (Text)


📌 Why this works:

This is the native trigger for integrating Power Automate with Copilot Studio.



---

🔹 Step 2: Call GPT to Generate DAX

✅ Feasibility: 100% using OpenAI API or Azure OpenAI

What you’re doing:

Asking GPT-4 to convert English into a DAX query

Input: User's message

Output: GPT returns raw DAX code


How:
Use HTTP module with:

Method: POST

URL: https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

Headers and body formatted for GPT


📌 Pro Tips:

Provide a well-scoped system prompt: define table/column names.

Keep GPT response strict to DAX (no explanation, just the formula).

Store the response into a variable: daxQuery



---

🔹 Step 3: Run DAX in Power BI

✅ Feasibility: 90% – available in Power Automate as a Preview Action

Use:

> Power BI → Run a query against a dataset



Inputs:

Workspace: Power BI Premium workspace

Dataset: Published dataset name

Query: @{variables('daxQuery')}


📌 Note:

It returns the result as a table

Ensure your DAX returns a tabular result that is simple (e.g., Top N, Sum by group, etc.)

This feature is preview, but works reliably for supported scenarios



---

🔹 Step 4: Format the Result

✅ Feasibility: 100%

Why needed:

The Power BI result is a JSON table — not user-friendly.

Use another GPT step (or Compose block) to format it nicely.


Example formatting logic:

Top 3 Products:
1. @{items('Apply_to_each')?['Product']} – $@{items('Apply_to_each')?['Amount']}

Or use GPT again:

{
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "messages": [
    { "role": "system", "content": "Format this Power BI table into a user-friendly summary..." },
    { "role": "user", "content": "Data: ..." }
  ]
}


---

🔹 Step 5: Return to Copilot

✅ Feasibility: 100%

Use:

> Power Virtual Agent → Return values to Copilot



📌 What happens:

Your bot receives the final answer from Power Automate and displays it.

No need for additional handling — Copilot auto-displays response.



---

3️⃣ Add Tool to Copilot Studio

✅ Feasibility: 100%

Steps:

1. Go to https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com


2. Open your bot


3. Go to Tools > Add a Tool


4. Select your Power Automate flow


5. In your topic, pass user’s input to flow


6. Show response in message block



📌 Tip: You can use conditions, fallback handling, or even suggest new questions based on the answer.

⚠️ Caveats & Considerations

Concern	How to Handle

GPT generates invalid DAX	Improve system prompt & schema clarity
Power BI DAX fails	Add try/catch in Power Automate
Slow GPT response	Use GPT-4-turbo or reduce system prompt
User inputs vague	Add guiding examples or refine before sending to GPT



---

✅ Summary: Why This is Feasible

Tool	Purpose	Status

GPT-4	Natural language → DAX	✅ Ready
Power Automate	Glue logic	✅ Supported
Power BI	Run queries	✅ With Premium
Copilot Studio	User interface	✅ Built-in
